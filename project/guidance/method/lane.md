# the lane — the tools, and the cage around them

<!-- AUTHORED TERSE. This register IS the source: the start-the-agent step
     assembles this file verbatim into the prompt layer. Edit the rule here. -->

Your native tools are blocked here, tool by tool, by an explicit list:

- Read
- Write
- Edit
- Bash
- Glob
- Grep
- web

Which file holds that list depends on the host. Claude Code reads
`.claude/settings.json`, and GitHub Copilot CLI takes the same list on its
command line from `deliverable/cage/copilot-cage.json`.

The effect is the one rule: the `se` lane replaces every native tool, as good
or better.

| you would reach for | use instead |
| --- | --- |
| Read | `se_file_read` (offset/limit for large files; returns the CAS hash) |
| Write | `se_file_write` (base_hash: null creates; hash from read overwrites) |
| Edit | `se_file_patch` (ops:[…] — many edits, many files, ONE atomic call) |
| a rename running through the tree | `se_file_replace` (one regex over a glob; every place it landed comes back with its line before and after) |
| Glob | `se_file_glob` |
| Grep | `se_file_search` (state your intent — it is logged) |
| ls | `se_file_list` |
| Bash | `se_run` (output captured in full under the returned ref) |
| git (via Bash) | `se_git` (allowlisted; push stays with the user) |
| WebFetch | `se_web_fetch` |
| WebSearch | ALLOWED natively — it runs on the provider's backend and cannot be self-hosted keylessly. Every query reaches the feed mechanically, through a hook. |
| your own history | `se_log_query` |

PATHS ARE ROOT-RELATIVE TO THE PROJECT ROOT, which is the parent of the folder
you have open. You open `project/`; a path you pass starts `project/`.

Every call is logged raw to `.se/calls.jsonl`.

TWO DOORS LEAD OUTSIDE THE ROOT, and neither is a path. A past version of this
repo is read at a committed ref — `se_file_read`, `se_file_search` and
`se_file_glob` all take `ref`.

Another folder entirely belongs in `.se/roots.json`, as a declared read-only
root. It is reachable as `@name/rest`. Ask the owner before declaring one.

WHEN A CALL IS REFUSED you get a typed rejection. It carries:

- the clause
- what was expected
- what it got
- an executable remedy, the exact call to make instead

Follow the remedy and recover in one turn. Never work around a refusal with
another lane.

A TRUNCATING PIPE IS REFUSED (SE-C-137), and a filter after a pipe counts:
`Select-String`, `findstr` and `grep` drop the lines they do not match, which
is where the totals live. The refusal names the lane verb that handles length
instead — `se_test`, `se_file_search`, `se_file_read`, or a whole run paged
back by ref. `no_tool_reason` runs it anyway and logs why.

WHAT IT CUTS. What `Select-Object -First`
dropped exists nowhere — not on the result, not in the log. Ends carry
verdicts: exit codes, totals, units. Prefer structured results (`se_test`) and
fetch full output by ref (`se_log_query`) over shaping it in the shell.

A RESULT THE HOST MOVED TO DISK IS RE-FETCHED BY REF, never by reading the
host's file. The lane logged the full response; `se_log_query` with the
call's ref serves it back. Retro finding 2026-08-10: several shell reads of
host-persisted files stood where one log query belonged.

Pass this file's rule to every subagent you spawn.
