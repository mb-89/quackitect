## current_situation

ONE NEW DESIGN SPEC AND FIFTEEN CHUNKS. The other twenty-three specs stand untouched.

dsp-write-guard realizes el-walk-engine and names six files — four new, two edited. The four new ones are the design: guard.ts holds the one pass, vocabulary.ts holds the enumerable keys, rules.ts holds what binds from the corpus, sweep.ts holds the whole-repo runner.

NO PROMOTIONS. At minor, M6 is struck, so no spike was ever seeded and none can be promoted. The table is empty because the milestone that fills it did not run.

## follow_up

OBSERVE-RED IS NEXT, and the engine fires it rather than the agent.

WHAT THE FIRST CHUNK DOES, and it is not code. write-budget-probe takes a NUMBER. Everything after it is committed to the answer, so nothing after it starts first.

THE FALLBACK IS ALREADY WIRED. If a corpus-reading check does not fit the write, rules.ts moves behind sweep.ts and the write reports rather than refusing. dsp-write-guard says so, and req-a-check-too-slow-for-the-write-moves-to-the-sweep demands it.

WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE PLAN. Only the probe. Chunks two and three read nothing but the incoming bytes and are provably cheap at 4 to 12 ms against 1000.

NOTHING IS BLOCKED.

## anything_else

### The two tables above were computed and typed back, again

SECOND INSTANCE IN TWO STATES. author-tests served a filled 55-row table and refused the submit that omitted it; this state served a filled 24-row table and wants the same.

THE ENGINE HAS THE ANSWER AT SERVE TIME. The realizes edges and the files lists are read from the spec nodes. Nothing in either table came from me except the one row I wrote.

req-a-coverage-check-computes-both-sides names the general form and now has four instances behind it, two of them prefill round trips rather than listings. That is a slightly different mechanism with the same cause: the corpus can answer and the agent is asked anyway.

### Why the empty promotions table is honest rather than lazy

THE LAW REFUSES AN UNASSIGNED PROMOTION, so an empty table has to be an empty truth rather than a shortcut.

AT MINOR, M6 IS STRUCK. rank-unknowns authors the spike drawing and run-spikes runs it, and both carry `minor: none`. No spike was seeded, so none exists to promote or lose.

THE ONE THING THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN A SPIKE IS THE WRITE-BUDGET NUMBER, and it is chunk one instead. M6_15's own note says needing a spike is the tell for a major; the owner chose minor and the measurement moved into the build, where it runs earlier and with less ceremony.

### What the file list commits to, and what it does not

FOUR NEW FILE NAMES ARE PLANNED, not written. The law at this state checks that a spec NAMES files; existence gets its teeth at trace-design, after the build.

THE SPLIT IS THE DESIGN AND IT IS ARGUABLE. guard.ts is one pass; vocabulary.ts and rules.ts are two different sources of what to check; sweep.ts is a different runner entirely.

IF THE BUILD MERGES TWO OF THEM, trace-design will find a named file nobody wrote and that is a finding to discuss rather than bury.
