# Evidence form / trace-design

## current_situation

The build closed with thirteen signed chunks.

This state checks the design against the code three ways: every element realized by some spec, every spec's named files existing, and every code file claimed by some spec.

The third is the dead-code sweep, and it is the one this record's new files have to answer to.

## follow_up

TWO FILES THIS RECORD ADDED WERE UNCLAIMED, and the sweep is what would have found them. Both are claimed here rather than left for it.

- `engine/channel.ts` joins `dsp-core-and-satellite`. It realizes `if-core-satellite`, which that spec already declares.
- `engine/bound.ts` joins `dsp-lane-door`. The answer bound acts at the lane's three exits in `mcp.ts`, which is that spec's own territory.

The record's other new files were already claimed by the specs that minted them: `resolve.ts`, `delta.ts`, `supervisor.ts`, `core.ts` and `satellite.ts`.

Verification comes next, and it wants a tester with fresh eyes rather than the builder.

## anything_else

One boundary this table makes visible.

`dsp-satellite-lifecycle` names four acts — START, WATCH, REPLACE, REAP — and its files are `supervisor.ts` and `worktree.ts`. REAP has no code in either.

That is not a gap this state can close. Reaping needs a record to close on a live satellite, and no satellite process is started yet. The design says so and the build plan agreed by putting the processes last.

Saying it here so the trace is read as it is, rather than as a full realization of every act the spec names.
