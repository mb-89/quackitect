# Evidence form / specify-build

## current_situation

The design specs stand at twenty, and the twentieth is new.

[[el-entrypoint]] HAD NO SPEC because it is the one element this iteration adds. Every other element was already realized by a standing spec.

TWO CONSTRAINTS ARE WRITTEN INTO IT rather than left for the build to rediscover, and both came from spikes that measured rather than reasoned.

## promotions

| experiment | promote | chunk |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [[exp-does-a-backgrounded-lane-release-its-caller]] | none | none — the child was a bare sleeping process |
| [[exp-what-runtime-the-engine-actually-needs]] | none | none — three declarations were read and nothing was written |
| [[exp-the-posix-branches-have-never-run]] | none | none — nothing was built |

## follow_up

- observe-red is next, and it has two cases that should be red today: the caller is not released, and a wrong runtime is not rejected by name
- ONE DECLARATION IS CORRECTED BY THIS SPEC: package.json's engines floor
- THE BUILD TARGETS THE POSIX BRANCH for the detach, because that is the branch a cloud host takes and the one that has never run
- THE TEST THAT PROVES `start` ASSERTS THE CALLER RETURNED BEFORE THE CHILD ENDED. A test that only checks the lane answers would pass while the command hangs.
- NOTHING WAS PROMOTED from any spike, so no chunk starts pre-verified
- nothing is parked from this state

## anything_else

### Why one new spec and not several

NINETEEN SPECS ALREADY REALIZE EVERY STANDING ELEMENT. This iteration added exactly one element, so it adds exactly one spec.

THE CHANGES TO [[el-claim-ledger]] AND [[el-record-store]] NEED NO NEW SPEC. Both are already realized by [[dsp-record-lifecycle]] and [[dsp-claim-lane]], which name `iterations.ts`, `claims.ts` and `worktree.ts` — the three files the claim and worktree decisions actually change.

### Which lenses shaped the order

RISK FIRST, and only that one. The method card asks which lenses shaped the plan, and here the answer is short because the work is short.

THE RISKIEST PIECE IS THE `start` STEP, and it is already measured as broken. A spine-first order would build seven steps and discover at integration what one measurement has already shown.

PARALLEL FLOW DOES NOT APPLY. This is one deep chain: verify before install, install before start, start before everything after it. Forcing width onto a chain only adds seams, and the card says so.

### What was promoted, and why nothing

THE THROWAWAY LAW COST NOTHING HERE. One spike spawned a sleeping process, one read three declarations, one ran a search.

THERE IS NO CODE TO BE TEMPTED BY. Every chunk starts from nothing, which is the honest position rather than an unfortunate one.
