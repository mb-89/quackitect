# Evidence form / trace-design

## current_situation

i34 stands at trace-design with all nine build chunks signed and the battery green: 1299 of 1299, run test-msvkb5yd-1.

THE TABLE IS DRAWN FROM THE NODES, not written here. What this state asserts is that the three mechanical laws hold over it: every element and interface realized, every named file on disk, every deliverable code file claimed.

TWENTY-THREE DESIGN SPECS, one fewer than i34 found and one more than it expected. dsp-claim-lane went with its element; dsp-unattended-entrypoint arrived with i28's merge.

## follow_up

- THE SEAM'S SPEC SURVIVES AND SHRINKS. dsp-resolution-seam still realizes el-resolution-seam and eight interfaces, and its files are unchanged — but what those files DO at the seam is now a constant. A path still resolves; there is one store to resolve it against.
- THE SPEC THAT LOST ITS FILES IS dsp-record-lifecycle. It named engine/claims.ts and engine/gitlane.ts under the old dsp-claim-lane; it now names iterations.ts and worktree.ts alone, both of which shrank.
- dsp-unattended-entrypoint CAME IN WITH i28 AND ITS FILES BOTH EXIST: engine/bin/se-start.ts and package.json. The entrypoint lost its adopt step in this iteration, so the spec's own prose was corrected at observe-red rather than here.
- NO NEW DESIGN SPEC IS AUTHORED. i34 removes mechanism and adds no element, which is what minor means at this row.
- NEXT IS verification.

## anything_else

THE DEAD-CODE SWEEP HAD SOMETHING TO FIND THIS TIME, and it was found by deleting rather than by sweeping.

engine/claims.ts WAS THE WHOLE CLAIM LEDGER, 379 lines, and it is deleted with its test file. Under the old table it was claimed by dsp-claim-lane; deleting the element deleted the spec, and the file would have become unclaimed. Both went together, so the sweep has nothing to report.

WHAT THE SWEEP CANNOT SEE is a file that is claimed and dead. tests/claims.test.ts was claimed by tsp-claim-lane right up until both were deleted, and no check would have complained about either. A claim is evidence that somebody meant the file to exist, never that it still does anything.

SO THE HONEST STATEMENT OF THIS STATE'S RESULT is narrow: nothing is unclaimed. Whether everything claimed is alive is a different question, and this iteration answered it by hand for the claim system and not at all for anything else.
