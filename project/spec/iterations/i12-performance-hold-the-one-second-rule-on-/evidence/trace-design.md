# Evidence form / trace-design

## current_situation

One engine file is added by this record and it is claimed: engine/testreporters.ts joins dsp-quality-toolchain, beside the two files the defect lived in.

engine/tools.ts is also added to that spec. The scoped runner lives there and the spec that owns test running never named it, which is a small part of why the gap survived: the file where the reporter list was missing was not on the list of files the test lane is made of.

Nothing else moves. No element, no interface, no new spec.

## follow_up

- Every file this record changed is claimed by a spec: testreporters.ts and tools.ts by dsp-quality-toolchain, selftest.ts and test-timings.mjs by the same, survey.ts by dsp-call-log, iterations.ts by dsp-record-lifecycle, session.ts by dsp-walk-machine.
- The two new test files are not listed. Design specs name the sources they realize, and a test file belongs to its test-spec, which author-tests already recorded.

## anything_else

ON A SPEC THAT DID NOT NAME THE FILE ITS DEFECT LIVED IN.

dsp-quality-toolchain realizes el-test-runner and lists nine files. Until this record, engine/tools.ts was not among them, and tools.ts is where a scoped run is built.

So the spec for the test lane described the battery's half of the lane and not the scoped half. That is not the cause of the missing reporter, but it is the reason nothing pointed at it: a reader asking what the test lane is made of got a list with the gap already outside it.

The trace does not prevent a defect. What it does is make the place a defect could hide smaller, and this is one square of that.
