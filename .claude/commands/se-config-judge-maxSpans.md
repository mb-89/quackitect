!`./RUNME.sh config judge.maxSpans $ARGUMENTS`

The line above runs before this turn opens, so `judge.maxSpans` reads what you type
after the name. Run `./RUNME.sh config` to read which layer answers a key:
`.se/config.json` beats the environment, and the environment beats
`spec/config/level0.json`.
