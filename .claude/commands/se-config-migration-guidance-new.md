!`./RUNME.sh config migration.guidance new`

The line above runs before this turn opens, so `migration.guidance` reads `new` from
here on. Run `./RUNME.sh config` to read which layer answers a key:
`.se/.runtime/config.json` beats the environment, and the environment beats
`spec/config/level0.json`.
