# Ask

The version guard and the git-write rows read the verb past git's global options and their values. The pre-push door refuses a version ref's rewrite beside its delete.

A force push to a version branch spelled with `--git-dir` and its value after a space passes both doors: `src/modules/hooks/command/guards.go:140`, finding 7.

- `./RUNME.sh test src/modules/hooks/command` refuses a force push and a delete spelled with `--git-dir` and `--work-tree`
- `./RUNME.sh test src/modules/hooks` passes a `PrePush` case refusing a version ref's rewrite
- `./RUNME.sh check` passes
