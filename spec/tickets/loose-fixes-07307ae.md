# Ask

The loose agent tickets on main land in this fix group, per [[spec/design_input/the-cloud-runs-itself#feature-groups-and-fix-groups]].

A fix group closes every ticket it holds. Work a person alone can do leaves it on the person route, loose on main.

- every ticket naming this group closes through the command it names
- `./RUNME.sh check` exits 0

The view: none.

The source: none.

# sync

<!-- takes trunk into the branch, so the box works on the latest -->

## sync

<!-- branch sync, so the branch carries trunk -->
<!-- the form is command -->

    ./RUNME.sh branch sync

# split

<!-- reads the standing children, and mints more where the goal needs them, each naming this group -->

## children

<!-- every child as a link, one a line, with its process -->
<!-- the form is list -->

- [[spec/tickets/secret-mode-holds-on-windows]] (trivial), closed

## checked

<!-- one line per item of the checklist, on how you take it into account -->
<!-- the form is checklist -->

- the one child reviews whole: it adds no code, only evidence
- the child is the only loose agent ticket on main naming this group, so it covers the goal
- no child waits on another
- no sibling reads apply
- the diff stays at ticket files, well inside one review
