# Ask

A rule naming a check the door holds nowhere says so in the log, so the hand
that wrote it reads its own mistake.

[[spec/design_output/stop]] says a `runs` the code holds nowhere writes one warn
line. The vote carries the unknown names out, and every caller drops that list,
so the line reaches the log nowhere. A rule with a typo in its `runs` then
stands silent, and a reader takes it as a rule that fires.

This note comes off the verdict on [[spec/tickets/the-controls-wire-up]], and
it stands outside that branch's hunks.

- the stop door writes one warn line per rule naming a check it holds nowhere
- a case drives the door with such a rule, and asserts the line stands in the log
- `./RUNME.sh check` answers 0

# design

## draft

<!-- writes the approach the ask calls for -->

### approach

<!-- the approach here where it takes minutes, or a link to the design output where it takes a note -->

<!-- the form is text -->

The stop door reads the `unknown` list the vote answers already, and writes one
warn line a name.

| the piece | what changes |
|---|---|
| `onStop` in `src/bridge/stop.js` | after the vote, writes `warn` under `stop` for each distinct name in `unknown`, naming the check and the rule file |
| `decide` in the hook's `lib/stop.js` | stays as it is, because it carries the names out today |
| the case | drives the door over the fake box with a rule whose `runs` names nothing, and asserts one warn line stands in the log |
| the design output | stays as it is, because the sentence promising the line stands there already |

The line stands in the log and nowhere in the block the door answers, because
the owner reads the log for a rule at fault, and the agent reads the block for
what to do next.
