# Ask

Every Bash or PowerShell call names the open ticket it serves, at the head of its description, as `<ticket>: what it does`. A patch names its ticket already, and Edit and Write stand refused. [[spec/design_output/level0#a-write-names-its-ticket]]

The gain is a reminder at every command. The agent meets the question which ticket it works on at the shell, as it meets it at each patch.

Without it a shell call writes through a verb or git with no ticket named, and the agent drifts off its ticket unseen.

- a shell call naming no open ticket refuses and names the form, and a test drives it
- a ticket pull, a mint and a note pass with no ticket named, and a test drives each
- `./RUNME.sh check` passes
