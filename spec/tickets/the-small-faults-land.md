# Ask

Every small fault a hand parks as a note lands fixed at once, and the next hand meets verbs and messages that say what the code does.

`fix` runs over the whole tree on an unknown flag, the name cap and the take state rules the code does not hold, a verdict table splits into list items, vale-ls finds no binary on Windows, the review's worktree fails on the webview packages, and a funnel note names a removed key.

- `fix` in `src/scripts/cli-check.js` refuses an unknown flag and writes nothing, and answers `--help` with its usage, which a case under `test/level0` decides
- the name cap refusals in `src/scripts/ticket.js`, `src/scripts/pull-chapter.js` and `.claude/skills/level0/lib/bash.js` say a name holds at most the cap, which the cases over each decide
- the take in `src/scripts/work.js` names the dependency a child waits on, and names a person for a step `by: person` alone, which a case under `test/level0` decides
- `verdictIn` in `src/scripts/pull-chapter.js` keeps a verdict's rows as rows, and `branch unblock` writes a findings table as that table, which a case in `test/level0/unblock.test.js` decides
- `settingsNameBinaries` in `src/lsp/tree.go` takes the Vale binary `src/scripts/install.sh` writes on each platform, which a case in `src/lsp/tree_test.go` decides
- `BORROWED` in `src/scripts/work-review.js` links `src/extension/webview/node_modules` into the review's worktree, which a case in `test/level0/review.test.js` decides
- `git grep writeAt -- spec/funnel` answers nothing
- `./RUNME.sh check` exits 0
