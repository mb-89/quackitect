# Ask

A work branch standing done waits for a review and a merge, and that wait is work of the desk. So the desk pull hands it out like a ticket. The hand runs the review, fixes what it names, merges from trunk and closes the branch.

Without it a done branch waits until a person remembers it, and the cloud's work lands late or not at all.

- a branch at done shows in the desk pull ahead of the free tickets, and a test drives it
- the hand-out names the review, the merge and the close as the steps, and the hand-back runs the merge
- a cloud box's pull hands out no such branch, and a test drives it
