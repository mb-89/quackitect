# Ask

<!-- gain, as text: what is gained by doing it, and not only what it does -->
<!-- breaks, as text: what breaks if it is never done -->
<!-- done_when, as list: one line each, decidable, naming the command that decides it -->
<!-- view, as text: the view the owner reads the change in and the number there, in the owner's words, or none -->
<!-- from, as text: handover where the ask comes off a handover line, so the owner reads it first, or none -->

gain: `claude plugin validate .claude/skills/level0` runs inside the check, so the manifest, `hooks/hooks.json` and the hooks module's load stand proved by the tool Claude Code ships. The smoke test then drops every probe validate already proves, and keeps only what a live session alone shows.

breaks: A broken manifest or hooks file reaches a session before anything flags it, and the smoke test keeps paying for proofs the standard tool gives for free.

done_when:
- `./RUNME.sh check` runs `claude plugin validate --strict .claude/skills/level0` and fails where it fails; the `plugin` part in `src/quack/check.go` already runs validate without `--strict`
- a Go test feeds `pluginHolds` a refusing validate and reads the part fail
- the smoke test holds no probe that validate proves; the level-zero-smoke group, on another box, meets the cut through `main`
- `./RUNME.sh check` exits 0

# design

## owner-read

<!-- reads the ask a handover carries, before any draft -->

### read

<!-- pass where the ask says what the owner said, or fail with the owner's words -->

<!-- the form is verdict -->

## draft

<!-- writes the approach the ask calls for -->

### approach

<!-- the approach here where it takes minutes, or a link to the design output where it takes a note -->
<!-- the form is text -->

The plugin part of the check, pluginHolds in src/quack/check.go, runs claude plugin validate with --strict, so a warning the runtime tolerates fails the check too. The standing case of check_test.go already feeds the part a refusing validate and reads it fail, so it now expects --strict in the argv. The design note line in level0.md that tells a person to run validate says the check runs it with --strict. The smoke cut takes nothing: validate reads the manifest, hooks.json, the module parse, the hooks it names and the nouns its source touches, statically. Each of the seven smoke checks reads runtime behavior through the Go door: door, rules, prompt, tools, guard, canary and quiet. So no smoke check repeats a proof validate gives, and the table under Discussion says so check by check.

### callers

<!-- every caller of what the approach changes, one a line, as a file and a function -->
<!-- the form is list -->

- src/quack/check.go partsOf, which names the plugin part
- src/quack/check_test.go the plugin part case, which drives pluginHolds

### tests

<!-- every test the change adds, one a line, as a file and a test name -->
<!-- the form is list -->

- src/quack/check_test.go the plugin part validates the plugin strictly, and passes where claude stands nowhere

### answers

<!-- every finding an earlier review names, one a line, with the answer the approach gives it, or first on a first draft -->
<!-- the form is list -->

- first

### size

<!-- every file the approach touches, one a line -->
<!-- the form is list -->

- src/quack/check.go
- src/quack/check_test.go
- spec/design_output/level0.md
- spec/tickets/level0-plugin-validate-in-check.md

### checked

<!-- one line per item of the checklist, on how you take it into account -->
<!-- the form is checklist -->

I opened check.go pluginHolds and partsOf, check_test.go, probe-dry.js DRY and SMOKE and smokeTree, and the note lines on validate, and each claim stands there
the callers list names partsOf and the plugin part case, the only callers of pluginHolds
the strict line meets the plugin part case, the refusing validate line meets the same case, the smoke line meets the table the gate reads, and the check line meets the check
the approach adds no config key

## tests-red

<!-- writes the tests the ask calls for -->

### tests

<!-- the tests you write fail on their own assertion -->

<!-- the form is command -->

<!-- every test file standing red until tests-green closes, one a line, which the check leaves out -->

<!-- the form is list -->

<!-- what you see, and what surprises you -->

<!-- the form is text -->

### checked

<!-- one line per item of the checklist, on how you take it into account -->

<!-- the form is checklist -->

# gate

<!-- reads the design phase against the ask, fixes what it finds within its own diff, and names the rest as points -->

## verdict

<!-- accept, accept with points naming a fix ticket a line, or reject with findings one a line -->

<!-- the form is verdict -->

# implement

## change

<!-- makes the change -->

### lint

<!-- the tree builds and lints -->

<!-- the form is command -->

### checked

<!-- one line per item of the checklist, on how you take it into account -->

<!-- the form is checklist -->

## tests-green

<!-- makes the tests pass -->

### tests

<!-- the same tests pass -->

<!-- the form is command -->

# accept

<!-- reads the diff since its last verdict against the ask and every prose criterion, and names what falls short as points -->

## verdict

<!-- accept, accept with points naming a fix ticket a line, or reject with findings one a line -->

<!-- the form is verdict -->

# view

<!-- reads the change in the view the ask names -->

## seen

<!-- pass where the view shows the ask's number, or fail with what it shows -->

<!-- the form is verdict -->

# Discussion

<!-- what anybody adds, at any time, on this ticket -->
