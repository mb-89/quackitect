# Ask

The owner says whether a cloud box opens its group's pull request. The work skill says it does, and `AGENTS.md` says a session opens none. The question comes from [[spec/tickets/the-cloud-works-its-queue]].

The agent takes the call `AGENTS.md` makes, and opens none. `AGENTS.md` names itself the rule over any other default, and a pull request reaches past the branch.

- the pull request over `work/the-cloud-works-its-queue`

- the answer names which rule stands, and the other file changes to match it
