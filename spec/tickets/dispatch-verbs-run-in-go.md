# Ask

Part of phase 11 of [[spec/design_input/the-migration-runs-in-slices#the-phases]]: the verbs dispatch leave Node.

Done when these verbs run in Go with their contract tests passing, and their JavaScript files, and every JavaScript module no remaining JavaScript imports, leave the tree.

# sync

<!-- takes trunk into the branch, so the box works on the latest -->

## sync

<!-- branch sync, so the branch carries trunk -->
<!-- the form is command -->

./RUNME.sh branch sync

# split

<!-- reads the standing children, and mints more where the goal needs them, each naming this group -->

## children

<!-- every child as a link, one a line, with its process -->
<!-- the form is list -->

- [[spec/tickets/dispatch-verbs-port-to-go]] (standard, closed)

## checked

<!-- one line per item of the checklist, on how you take it into account -->
<!-- the form is checklist -->

- small enough: the one child ports one verb, dispatch, and its review read it whole
- adds up to the goal: src/quack/dispatch.go registers dispatch in Go, src/scripts/verbs holds no dispatch.js, no file in src, test or .claude imports the dispatch modules that left, every module they imported keeps other importers, and ./RUNME.sh check exits 0, so I mint no further child
- depends_on: the one child waits on no sibling
