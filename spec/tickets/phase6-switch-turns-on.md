# Ask

<!-- breaks, as text: what breaks if it is never done -->
<!-- done_when, as list: one line each, decidable, naming the command that decides it -->

The phase-6 shadow now runs. Since [[spec/tickets/window-keeps-the-index]], the window reaches the index and leaves it standing. Over the real session log it names no mismatch, and over a seeded copy it names one. Turning `migration.phase6switch` on lets a box take [[spec/tickets/tui-shell-switches-over]] once its other waits clear.

- `./RUNME.sh config` reads `migration.phase6switch true`
- the window over the session log writes no window row, while the index holds one pid
- `./RUNME.sh check` exits 0
