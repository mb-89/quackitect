# Ask

<!-- gain, as text: what is gained by doing it, and not only what it does -->
<!-- breaks, as text: what breaks if it is never done -->
<!-- done_when, as list: one line each, decidable, naming the command that decides it -->

the family table of spec/design_output/doors.md still names src/quack/cli_test.go, src/quack/dump_test.go, src/quack/main_test.go, src/quack/placements_test.go, src/quack/io_test.go, src/index/watch_test.go, src/watcher/watcher_test.go and src/watcher/watchertest/watchertest_test.go as door tests of a real thing, and after the moves none of them reaches one. The owner tests each door against the real thing once, so each row names its contract files alone.
