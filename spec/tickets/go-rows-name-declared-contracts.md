# Ask

<!-- gain, as text: what is gained by doing it, and not only what it does -->
<!-- breaks, as text: what breaks if it is never done -->
<!-- done_when, as list: one line each, decidable, naming the command that decides it -->

the Go contract table in spec/design_output/doors.md names `src/index/contract_test.go`, `src/index/bus_test.go` and `src/index/procs_test.go` as contract suites, but src/index/owns.yaml declares only index_contract_test.go, detach_contract_test.go and detach_windows_contract_test.go under contract, and none of the three ends `_contract_test.go` as the chapter A door names its contract tests asks. The rows name the suites the declaration holds, or say the fake-keeps-a-contract suite stands apart from the door's contract tests.
