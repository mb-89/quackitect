# Ask

An answer the agent writes mid-turn reaches the owner in the chat at that moment, in markdown, and the door reads it there. So a question the owner asks mid-turn meets its answer where they read.

Today the answer lands in the log alone until the turn ends. The viewer draws it as one run of plain text, and the answer door warns on every call after it. Three moments in this box's log show each.

- a report mid-turn stands in the chat and in the log both, and a test drives the chat road
- the viewer draws the detail of a log line as markdown, so a list and a table keep their shape
- the answer door reads a report as the answer and warns on no call after, and a test drives it
