# Ask

<!-- gain, as text: what is gained by doing it, and not only what it does -->
<!-- breaks, as text: what breaks if it is never done -->
<!-- done_when, as list: one line each, decidable, naming the command that decides it -->

the draft puts ends-on-a-question in ReadsText so the stop call skips it, but ReadsText gates only the reason a stop call names (src/modules/hooks/stops.go Stops.claims), and a-cloud-box-decides is a continue, never a reason; implement drops the entry and the last assertion of TestEndsOnQuestionReadsTheLastProse, or keeps both as harmless
