# Ask

<!-- gain, as text: what is gained by doing it, and not only what it does -->
<!-- breaks, as text: what breaks if it is never done -->
<!-- done_when, as list: one line each, decidable, naming the command that decides it -->

the deny names mcp__github__merge_pull_request alone, and this box also carries a second GitHub connector whose merge_pull_request tool sits under its own mcp__<uuid>__ prefix, and gh pr merge through Bash. Deny the merge tool under every GitHub connector the box loads, and leave enable_pr_auto_merge open, since the work skill turns auto-merge on through the connector. Unchecked: whether the client takes a glob in a deny rule.
