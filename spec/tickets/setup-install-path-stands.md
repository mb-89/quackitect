# Ask

<!-- gain, as text: what is gained by doing it, and not only what it does -->
<!-- breaks, as text: what breaks if it is never done -->
<!-- done_when, as list: one line each, decidable, naming the command that decides it -->

The claude.ai environment's setup script, an owner-only setting outside the tree, runs `src/scripts/install.sh`, and the install moved to the root `install.sh`. A shim at the old path runs the root install with its arguments, and holds no install logic of its own.

The gain is a new cloud box that starts installed again, with no wait on the owner changing a setting.

Without it every new cloud box starts with no binary, and the first verb on it fails.

- `src/scripts/install.sh` runs the root `install.sh` with every argument it takes, in two lines
- `./RUNME.sh check` accepts the shim beside the check that lists the files a shell runs
- a test runs the shim and sees the root install reached, under `go -C src/quack test ./...`
