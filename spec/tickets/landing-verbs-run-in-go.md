# Ask

Part of phase 11 of [[spec/design_input/the-migration-runs-in-slices#the-phases]]: the verbs commit, push and rename leave Node.

Done when these verbs run in Go with their contract tests passing, and their JavaScript files, and every JavaScript module no remaining JavaScript imports, leave the tree.

# sync

<!-- takes trunk into the branch, so the box works on the latest -->

## sync

<!-- branch sync, so the branch carries trunk -->
<!-- the form is command -->

./RUNME.sh branch sync

# split

<!-- reads the standing children, and mints more where the goal needs them, each naming this group -->

## children

<!-- every child as a link, one a line, with its process -->
<!-- the form is list -->

- [[spec/tickets/landing-verbs-port-to-go]], standard, closed

## checked

<!-- one line per item of the checklist, on how you take it into account -->
<!-- the form is checklist -->

- the one child is a reviewable change of three Go files, their tests and the JavaScript they replace
- the child's done lines are the group's ask: the Go verbs, their tests, the deleted programs and their importers; an orphan search of src names no module the three verbs left behind, only verb programs loaded by name and webview files other groups own
- one child, so no depends_on
