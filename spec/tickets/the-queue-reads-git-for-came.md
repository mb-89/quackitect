# Ask

The box takes this call: `queue.stood` stays wired `built-in`, so the day weight scores zero on the new queue path, and a git IO module later answers the time each path came in, off `git log`. No ticket front carries a time, and the file table's `Changed` moves on every edit, so no source without git stands. The open-tasks count reads no score, so the shadow stands unmoved. The owner takes the call, or names a source of the time that reads no git. The question comes from [[spec/tickets/queue-reads-when-tickets-came]].

- the day term of the new queue order, which scores zero until a source stands

- the answer stands under answer, and `./RUNME.sh ticket yours` no longer names this ticket
