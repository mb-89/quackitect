# Ask

The JS test files the JS test audit marks DELETE leave with the unloaded modules behind them, so the suite tests only code that runs.

The check keeps running tests of code nothing loads. A reader keeps meeting a bridge server, rule, prose and schema modules, verb programs and golden writers that no path calls.

- the tree holds no test file `audit/test-audit-js.txt` marks DELETE, re-verified against the tree, and no unloaded module it tests
- `sym.cjs` on the audit branch decides what loads
- the JS take-path test files stay for `js-take-path-leaves`
- the live test/level0 files stay for level-zero-becomes-a-typed-mod
- `./RUNME.sh check` exits 0
