# Ask

Does the processes slice switch over? The owner answers this, once its shadow runs clean for as long as the owner judges enough. A box answers none of it. [[spec/design_output/work#the-owner-opens-the-gate]] names the commands.

- [[spec/tickets/module-processes-switch-over]] and every child of it wait for this ticket to close
- `./RUNME.sh log --kind shadow` names no mismatch of the slice since its shadow group lands on `main`
