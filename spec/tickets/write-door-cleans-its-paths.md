# Ask

<!-- gain, as text: what is gained by doing it, and not only what it does -->
<!-- breaks, as text: what breaks if it is never done -->
<!-- done_when, as list: one line each, decidable, naming the command that decides it -->

`RelativeTo` in `src/modules/hooks/write/door.go` strips the root by a raw string prefix, so a doubled slash or a dot-dot spelling of an in-tree path reads as outside, and the write door lets it through with no ticket. The door cleans both sides before it compares, and reads a result climbing out of the root as outside.

The gain is a write door that holds every spelling of an in-tree path.

Without it a non-canonical spelling lands a write in the tree with no ticket named.

- `RelativeTo` answers the tree path for a doubled slash and a dot-dot spelling of an in-tree file
- a path climbing out of the root stays outside
- the cases run under `go -C src/modules test ./hooks/...`
