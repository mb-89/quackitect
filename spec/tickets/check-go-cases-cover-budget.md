# Ask

<!-- gain, as text: what is gained by doing it, and not only what it does -->
<!-- breaks, as text: what breaks if it is never done -->
<!-- done_when, as list: one line each, decidable, naming the command that decides it -->

the first done_when line asks a Go case for every road the JavaScript tests cover, and no red Go case reads battery.budget off the config (check-verb.test.js budgetOf), the warn line the log takes past the budget, the CGO_ENABLED=0 environment goGate runs under (goEnvOf), the port off the vehicle pointer (portHere), the level0 red line the check shouts, or the test verb with words handing its names to branch test under a fresh tally (cli-verbs.test.js namedTests); add a case for each before tests-green closes
