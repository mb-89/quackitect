# Ask

a read goes through find and patch, and the shell keeps the rest

hundreds of shell reads stand where one verb answers

- find, patch and replace answer on the first call of a session
- a case covers each tool answering through the bridgehead

# design

## draft

<!-- writes the approach the ask calls for -->

### approach

<!-- the approach here where it takes minutes, or a link to the design output where it takes a note -->
<!-- the form is text -->

The plugin registers every read tool at session start, and the first call brings the server up.

| what stands today | what it costs |
|---|---|
| the specs ride the server's answer to `session.start` | a box whose server answers nothing carries no read tool all session |
| `starts` runs after that answer falls | the start lands, and the registration stands already past |
| the start reads `node_modules`, and a fresh box carries none | the setup answers 6, and the hand falls to the shell |

| what changes | where |
|---|---|
| the specs stand under the skill folder, so the plugin reads them with no server | `.claude/skills/level0/lib` |
| the bridge reads those same specs | `src/bridge/search.js` and `src/bridge/apply.js` |
| `register` names them at session start, whatever the server answers | the plugin's `register` |
| a handler meeting no server starts one, waits on its health, and calls again | the plugin's tool road |
| the start installs where the modules stand absent | `START` in the plugin |

So a hand calls `find` on its first turn, and that call pays for the server.

- the plugin imports nothing past its own folder, so the specs move and the bridge points at them
- the answer's `register` list still stands, so a server carrying a newer spec still names it
- the cases drive each tool with no server standing, and read the answer

[[spec/design_output/level0#the-bridgehead-starts-it-too]] takes the order.
