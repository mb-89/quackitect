# Ask

A person runs one shell call through Copilot in VS Code, and reads whether the hooks door lets it through. Copilot's shell call carries no description, so the door may refuse every one. A box holds no Copilot host, so it reads none of this. The work comes from [[spec/tickets/copilot-answers-off-the-door]].

The commands, in order:

1. `./RUNME.sh serve`
2. `node src/scripts/copilot.js setup vscode`
3. In Copilot's agent chat on this tree, ask: Run ls in the terminal.
4. `./RUNME.sh log --kind copilot --last 5`

- `./RUNME.sh log --kind copilot --last 5` names the `PreToolUse` row of the `ls` call, as complete or as the refusal it met
