# Ask

The reviewer reads a group's retro off the group ticket, where the route writes it, and reports present where it stands. A reader of the report trusts the retro line.

Today the reviewer reads the retro off the handover file alone, and a group branch carries none. So every done group reads retro absent, and the line says nothing.

- `./RUNME.sh branch review <group>` reads the retro chapter of the group ticket, and a test drives it over a fixture
- a branch with a handover file keeps its reading, and the test drives both roads
- the report on a done group with a written retro says present
