# Ask

**The gain.** A reader tells the three kinds of private file apart by the folder they stand in. The retro reads its own half and walks past the rest. The index answers a question over a private note the way it answers one over any other note.

**What breaks otherwise.** One folder name covers three purposes. The retro reads files nobody writes for it, and a question over a private note answers off the disk or answers nothing.

[[spec/design_input/the-runtime-files-stand-apart]] carries the ask.

- `.se` holds one folder for the retro's files and one for the runtime's
- every writer names the folder its files belong to
- the index walk covers the private folder and stands outside the runtime half
- a word standing in a private note alone comes back from a `find`
- `./RUNME.sh check` answers 0

# design

## draft

<!-- writes the approach the ask calls for -->

### approach

<!-- the approach here where it takes minutes, or a link to the design output where it takes a note -->

<!-- the form is text -->

Two named folders stand under the private folder. The rest of it keeps its
place. The folder a file stands in says which kind it is.

| kind | where it stands | who reads it |
|---|---|---|
| retro | `.se/retro` | the retro, as its own |
| runtime | `.se/run` | the box that wrote it |
| the rest | `.se` itself | the retro, and a question over the index |

One module owns the two names. Every writer takes its folder from there. A
reader finds the rule in one place, and a later kind lands beside it.

The runtime folder takes the files dying with the box, one to a line:

- the index rows
- the tools survey
- the log
- the hold
- the box's own record

The rest keeps the notes, the handover and the private tickets. A reader asks
after each of them.

The index walk drops the private folder from its skip list. It skips the runtime
folder in its place. A skip on a name alone reaches the wrong folder, so the
walk reads the path under the root. The rows then answer a `find` over a private
note.
