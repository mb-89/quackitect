# Ask

The check rules fire where their notes say and read only what they name, and the index answers every query and every hung action in bounded time. The verbs that move, split, commit and run report what happened on disk. Done when every child closes through the command it names, or closes with the reason its fix costs more than it buys.

# Discussion

<!-- what anybody adds, at any time, on this ticket -->

The owner approves this group off the review fleet's list on the `review/` branch, each finding re-checked by a skeptic. The route runs this way:

- `./RUNME.sh branch open` commits a marker on `main` and pushes it, so the box cuts `work/checks-and-index-read-right` off `main` by hand, as the branches of `#138` and `#140` did
- each child runs the trivial route: the finding's fix sketch is the design, and its `do` step lands a failing case before the fix
- the two door findings on `src/index/door.go`, the dropped watch error and the guard held through a drain, share one child
- a child whose fix costs more than it buys closes with that reason, and the group widens past the list nowhere
