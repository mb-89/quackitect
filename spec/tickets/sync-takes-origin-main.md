# Ask

<!-- gain, as text: what is gained by doing it, and not only what it does -->
<!-- breaks, as text: what breaks if it is never done -->
<!-- done_when, as list: one line each, decidable, naming the command that decides it -->

A desk session that commits on `main` takes the remote's `main` in through a verb. So its push lands after another box pushes first.

Today a desk whose `main` parts from the remote stands with no road to push:

- `branch sync` refuses on `main`
- `branch merge` takes work and cloud branches alone
- level zero refuses `git pull` and `git merge`

Done when:

- `./RUNME.sh branch sync` on `main` merges `origin/main` in. A case in `test/level0/work-sync.test.js` decides it
- on a conflict it stops, names the files, and leaves the merge to the hand. The same file holds a case for it
- on a work branch it takes `main` in as it does today. The same file holds a case for it
- `./RUNME.sh check` exits 0
