# Evidence form / trace-design

## current_situation

One new design spec, dsp-the-arrival, realizing el-arrival, naming three files. Twenty-nine specs stand in the register.

The laws here check coverage both ways and sweep for code no spec claims. The new files are claimed; the question is whether anything else went unclaimed.

## follow_up

- tests/arrival.test.ts is claimed through tsp-the-arrival rather than through a design spec, which is how test files are traced here.
- If the shared module between se-arrive and se-start ever lands, dsp-the-arrival and the entrypoint spec both change, and the file lists move with them.

## anything_else

THREE FILES ARE CLAIMED AND ONE OF THEM IS NOT UNDER project/deliverable.

.claude/settings.json sits at the repository root, and it is named in the spec deliberately rather than left out for tidiness. It is the only file a fresh clone reads at session start, so it is the wire without which the hook is unreachable — a design spec that named only the two engine files would describe a mechanism that never fires.

THE DEAD-CODE SWEEP HAS ONE THING TO SAY THAT THIS ITERATION CREATED. Four functions now have two implementers, se-arrive.ts and se-start.ts, and neither file is dead. That is not unclaimed code; it is duplicated code, which this state does not check for and the element matrix does. It is filed as raid-iss-two-entrypoints-place-the-cage-and-nothing-compares-them.
